# PCV Order Acceptance Bot

This Python project automates the acceptance and countering of real estate valuation orders from the **PCV Murcor** portal via web scraping and email processing.

It reads emails, classifies them as new or counter quote requests, and takes automated actions based on client configurations â€” including order acceptance, counter quote submission, and logging.
